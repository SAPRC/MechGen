The SAPRC mechanism generation system, or MechGen, derives explicit mechanisms for the gas-phase reactions of many types of emitted organic compounds and their oxidation products when they react in the atmosphere in the presence of oxides of nitrogen and other pollutants. It then uses the results to derive lumped mechanisms suitable for use in atmospheric models. Preliminary documentation of the basic MechGen system is available, and additional documentation is in preparation. A paper documenting the scientific basis of the estimation methods and chemical assignments is under review and is available for public comment until November 15, 2023. In addition, information about the estimates and assignments can be obtained within the system, and is also output when reactions are generated in a step-by-step manner.

This system was used to derive the SAPRC-22 chemical mechanism, which is the latest version of the SAPRC mechanisms.
