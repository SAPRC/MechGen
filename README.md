# SAPRC Mechanism Generation System (MechGen)

The **SAPRC mechanism generation system** (**MechGen**) derives explicit mechanisms for the gas-phase reactions of many types of emitted organic compounds and their oxidation products when they react in the atmosphere in the presence of oxides of nitrogen and other pollutants. It then uses the results to derive lumped mechanisms suitable for use in atmospheric models.

MechGen was used to derive the SAPRC-22 chemical mechanism, which is the latest version of the [SAPRC](https://intra.engr.ucr.edu/~carter/SAPRC/) mechanisms. You can access MechGen publicly via the [MechGen](http://mechgen.cert.ucr.edu/) website.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes the following files:

- **MechGen.db**: The main database for MechGen. This file is needed if you want to install and run MechGen on your own computer. It is not required for web users.

- **MechGenGuide.pdf**: The complete user manual providing detailed instructions for using MechGen via the web interface or command line. 

- **README.md**: This overview of the repository.

## Getting Started

To help you get started, refer to the following documents:

* [Getting Started with MechGen Web Access](https://github.com/SAPRC/MechGen/wiki/Getting-started-with-web-access)

  A quick guide to using the [web version of MechGen](http://mechgen.cert.ucr.edu/). No installation needed. A PDF version of this guide is also available. 

* [Installing and Running MechGen on Unix or Linux Systems](https://github.com/SAPRC/MechGen/wiki/Install-and-Run-MechGen-on-Unix-or-Linux-Systems)

  A guide for installing and running MechGen on Unix or Linux.
