# SAPRC Mechanism Generation System (MechGen)

The **SAPRC mechanism generation system** (**MechGen**) is a tool designed to derive explicit mechanisms for the gas-phase reactions of many types of emitted organic compounds and their oxidation products when they react in the atmosphere in the presence of oxides of nitrogen and other pollutants. It then uses the results to derive lumped mechanisms suitable for use in atmospheric models.

## Access MechGen online
MechGen is easy to access! No installation is required for the web version, which you can use directly from your browser. However, if you prefer Telnet access, you’ll need to install Telnet on your system:
- **Web Access**:<br>[Click here to try MechGen online](http://149.165.173.164:8000/)

- **Telnet Access**:<br>Open a terminal and connect to MechGen via Telnet:  
  ```
  telnet 149.165.173.164 8888
  ```
