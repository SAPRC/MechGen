# Run SAPRC/MechGen mechanism with F0AM

An extension of F0AM has been developed that allows it to run with the SAPRC mechanisms (SAPRC07, SAPRC22) as well as mechanisms generated by MechGen. The SAPRC/MechGen photolysis calculation FORTRAN codes have been rewritten in MATLAB to integrate seamlessly with F0AM.

Here is the link to the repository for this project: https://github.com/SamihaShahid/SAPRC_F0AM

If you have any issues setting up SAPRC chemistry in F0AM, please contact Dr. Samiha Binte Shahid (sbint003@ucr.edu) or Dr. Jia Jiang (jiajiang@mit.edu).
