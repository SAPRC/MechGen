# Run SAPRC/MechGen mechanism with F0AM

An extension of F0AM has been developed that allows it to run with the SAPRC mechanisms (SAPRC07, SAPRC22) as well as mechanisms generated by MechGen. The SAPRC/MechGen photolysis calculation FORTRAN codes have been rewritten in MATLAB to integrate seamlessly with F0AM.

Here is the link to the repository for this project: https://github.com/SamihaShahid/SAPRC_F0AM

If you have any issues setting up SAPRC chemistry in F0AM, please contact Samiha Binte Shahid (sbint003@ucr.edu) or Jia Jiang (jiajiang@mit.edu).


# Scripts to convert MechGen outputs into F0AM-ready inputs
The conversion of MechGen complex outputs into product files compatible with other modeling systems, such as F0AM, is currently under active collaboration in a separate project.

Here, we provide the **mg_output_mech2f0am.py** script, which offers a preliminary example of converting a MechGen output isoprene mechanism into a F0AM-ready input file. While this script is not yet fully refined, it serves as a simple illustrative example.
